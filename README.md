These are all the task for this project:

0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life

1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't

2. With a face like mine, I do better in print

3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print

4. Nothing in fine print is ever good news
